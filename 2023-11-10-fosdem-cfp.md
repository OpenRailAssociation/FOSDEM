# Railways and Open Transport Devroom at FOSDEM 2024 - Call for Participation

We are excited to announce that for the second time there will be a **Railways and Open Transport devroom** at FOSDEM, after its [amazing debut in 2023](https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/railways_and_open_transport/). Together, we explore the space of Free and Open Source Software in the context of railways and public transport. We invite you to participate by presenting your work and projects in this space. Once again, this will be excellent opportunity to show what you are doing and discuss it with like-minded people from the community.
