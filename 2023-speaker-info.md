Thank you for offering to speak at FOSDEM 2023!

CHECKLIST
=========
- Check the schedule shows what you expect
- Upload a photo, biography and a logo for your talk.
- If you are part of the virtual event online, upload the video
  of your talk as soon as possible (now due this weekend,
  Sun 29th January).


SCHEDULE
========
Firstly, this is what the database thinks is your schedule:

[*Your talks here*]

All times are Brussels local time - CET - UTC+1.  Rooms beginning 'D.'
indicate virtual devrooms: Everything else happens at ULB in Brussels.

Please let us know quickly if the day or time needs to be changed or is missing or if it says 'unconfirmed' and you don't know why.


PHOTO AND BIOGRAPHY
===================
Please upload a photograph of yourself if you have not already done so and enter or update your biography.  You can use markdown formatting within your abstracts and biographies, as described here:
  https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax

Changes take a few minutes to reach the website (once the talk is scheduled and the status is 'confirmed') - the time it was last updated appears at the bottom of this page:
  https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/events/

You should also upload a small image to be displayed with your talk both on the website and with the matrix chat room for pre-recorded talks.  (For example, if the talk is about a project, you might use the project logo.)  Note that the tiff format isn't supported.

You can login and update the information at:
  https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/

If you have never logged in before or forgotten your password, go to
  https://penta.fosdem.org/user/forgot_password

to receive an email to set a new password by entering the username:

  [*Your username*]

(If the line above is blank, reply to this email and we'll create you an account.)


SLIDES
======
Any slide decks you present should be uploaded (into pentabarf) by about half-an-hour before the start of your talk so that people watching the live stream can follow them locally if their video resolution or poor bandwidth leaves slide content indistinct.  (Our system does not hold back publication, so if you don't want people to see them too far in advance, don't upload them yet or leave the 'public' checkbox un-ticked and tick it later.  You could also omit from the uploaded version any surprises or answers you don't want to reveal in advance.)

FOSDEM intends to record and stream the whole conference (except BOFs) live.  The recordings will be published under the same licence as all FOSDEM content (CC-BY).  You are agreeing to this by taking part in the event.

If you're giving your presentation in Brussels, please don't forget to bring an HDMI adaptor if you intend to use a laptop that only has a different type of output connector!  We also recommend bringing a spare copy of any slides on a USB stick.

As usual, we aim to provide free high-quality wireless network connectivity throughout the event.


T-SHIRTS
========
Participants may purchase T-shirts and hoodies in advance from
  https://treasure.fosdem.org/

These MUST be collected from the K infodesk on Saturday.  This lets you avoid the initial rush and collect your order at a quieter time of day.

Only a proportion of our stock is offered online, so if your size has run out, don't order a size that won't fit, but come to the infodesk early instead.


SPOUSE TOURS
============
We are once again offering free tours of Brussels for a limited number of partners who accompany you to Brussels but don't want to spend all their time at FOSDEM.  Speakers have booking priority for the next couple of days before we offer any remaining places more widely.

On both days, the meeting point is on campus at 12:15.

On Saturday the tour takes you around the centre of Brussels and ends watching a silent movie before returning to ULB for 18:30.  On Sunday, the tour is centred on the Comics Art Museum, and returns to campus for 16:30.

Contact tour@fosdem.org to book or to obtain further details.

MATRIX
======
For the virtual event we are using the same Matrix platform that we used successfully for the last two years.  Additionally, physical devrooms taking place in Brussels will have a corresponding matrix channel available for chat and text-based Q&A.


IF YOU ARE PRESENTING IN PERSON IN BRUSSELS THEN YOU MAY IGNORE THE REST OF THIS EMAIL.

[*Redacted the rest of it as our devroom is on-site only*]


Best wishes,

The FOSDEM Programme Team
