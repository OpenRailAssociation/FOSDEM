# Railways and Open Transport Devroom at FOSDEM 2024 - Call for Participation

We are excited to announce that for the second time there will be a **Railways and Open Transport devroom** at FOSDEM, after its [well-received debut in 2023](https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/railways_and_open_transport/). Together, we explore the space of Free and Open Source Software in the context of railways and public transport. We invite you to [participate](https://fosdem.org/submit) by presenting your work and projects in this space. Once again, this will be excellent opportunity to show what you are doing and discuss it with like-minded people from the community.
