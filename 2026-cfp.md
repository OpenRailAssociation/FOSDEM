# Railways and Open Transport Devroom at FOSDEM 2026 - Call for Participation

We are excited to announce that for the fouth time in a row, there will be a **Railways and Open Transport devroom** at FOSDEM. Together, we will explore the space of Free and Open Source Software in the context of railways and public transport. See our previous editions in [2023](https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/railways_and_open_transport/), [2024](https://archive.fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/railways-and-open-transport/) and [2025](https://archive.fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/railways/).

We invite you to [participate](https://fosdem.org/submit) by presenting your work and projects in this space. We are primarily looking for 20 minutes presentations and also welcome short lightning talks. Please submit them at https://fosdem.org/submit.

Once again, this will be an excellent opportunity to show what you are doing and discuss it with like-minded people from the community.
