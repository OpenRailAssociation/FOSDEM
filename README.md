You will find information about how to get to the venue [here](https://fosdem.org/2025/practical/transportation/).

## Speaker information

Timing:
* Please be in the devroom at least 5 minutes before the start of your talk so we can connect your equipment and wire you up.
* We will have to cut you off 5 minutes before the scheduled end of your talk to allow the audience to switch rooms and set up the next speaker.
* There is no fixed Q&A time, but we would appreciate if you planned some minutes for the audience to ask questions.
* Please note that FOSDEM hallways are very crowded and rooms sometimes hard to find, so plan for extra minutes to get from A to B.

Presentation:
* You don't have to send us your slides beforehand, but of course you can so we have them as back-up.
* Please use your own device to present. On-site you will typically find a HDMI cable and some adapters, but please bring your own adapter to be sure.
* The presentation can be in the typical 16:10 format and should also be readable in lower resolutions and from a larger distance.
