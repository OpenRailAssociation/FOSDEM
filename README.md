## Call for Presentations

The [Call for Participation](2025-cfp.md) his open and we are looking forward to your proposals. Please don't hesitate and submit presentations for anything open around railways and open transport you are working on.

The devroom will take place on February 2 2025 in the afternoon.

## Attendee information

Details will be added as soon as they are available.

## Speaker information

Timing:
* Please be in the devroom at least 5 minutes before the start of your talk so we can connect your equipment and wire you up.
* We will have to cut you off 5 minutes before the scheduled end of your talk to allow the audience to switch rooms and set up the next speaker.
* There is no fixed Q&A time, but we would appreciate if you planned some minutes for the audience to ask questions.
* Please note that FOSDEM hallways are very crowded and rooms sometimes hard to find, so plan for extra minutes to get from A to B.

Presentation:
* You don't have to send us your slides beforehand, but of course you can so we have them as back-up.
* Please use your own device to present. On-site you will typically find a HDMI cable and some adapters, but please bring your own adapter to be sure.
* The presentation can be in the typical 16:10 format and should also be readable in lower resolutions and from a larger distance.
